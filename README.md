# Geometric Shapes Calculator

This is a command-line application written in Rust that allows you to calculate various properties of geometric shapes such as rectangles, triangles, trapezoids, and circles. The application provides a menu-driven interface for selecting the desired shape and entering the required dimensions.

## Features

Calculate properties for four different shapes:
 - Rectangle: perimeter, area, and diagonal length
 - Trapezoid: perimeter, area, and length of the midline
 - Circle: circumference, area, and area of a circular sector
